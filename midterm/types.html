            there are special editions added on to these types of Wranglers. For instance the Jeep Wrangler JK has a different interior that is newer and a more updated version
            than the TJ, which was the addition before the JK model. Along with that there are different features that are also upgraded such as the body style of Jeep Wrangler. 
            The Jeep Wranger Sport edition is the Wrangler with the least amount of upgrades. The Rubicon is the most upgraded version you are able to purchase of the Jeep Wrangers.
