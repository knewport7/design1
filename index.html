             <p>Hi everyone! Here's a little bit about myself. I am going to school for Grapgic Arts Tech and can't wait to learn more about it. I have been going to Chattanooga State since I was a sophomore in high school. I am excited to see where I go in life as I persure this new journey!  </p>
