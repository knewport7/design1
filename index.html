     <h3>"I prefer Apple laptops"</h3>
     <h4>"Some reasons why I believe these laptops to be the best!"</h4>

     <p>I like to believe that Apple has one of the best laptops ever made. Apple laptops create endless ways to connect to other divices including your phone if you have an Iphone.
        I enjoy being able to connect my phone to my laptop so that I am able to use the same functions if my phone isn't around. I am able to easily answer messages that go directly to my phone
        that end up also going straight to my laptop so it is easier to access while I am doing other work from it. Also, with the laptop everything seems much easier to access such as, folder, files, 
        websites, etc.</p>
     <p>When I first purchased an Apple laptop I was unaware of all of the special features it had but ever since then I would never go back to another brand. I enjoy having everything I need at my
        my fingertips when it is available. The laptop functions as a normal computer, but also as a phone. I am able to answer calls and text just as I would on my normal device. I would say that is the most
        enjoyable thing about an Apple laptop, but not only that, it is one of the lasted loading laptops I have ever owned.
