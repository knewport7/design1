                <p>When I became familiar with the group BTS I didn't realize how meaningful their music was. As I started listening and reading about the meaning of the lyrics
                    I started to enjoy their music much more. At first I would skip their song because I couldn't understand them, but soon after I began to listen the harrmony and tone
                    of their voice started to make me think that the song had much more meaning after all.  
                </p>

                <p>
                I was introduced to this group from my sister. She had told me about them as she had listen to them for a while. At first I was not very 
                interested because I could not understand their music, but as she talked more about them and the reasoning and meaning behind each song and 
                the meanings of their albums I became very facinated in their music. Some artist do not have as deep of a meaning to their music but BTS has great 
                meaning with such detail behind every song they create. They love to also include their listeners emotions into each song which I also find very 
                interesting and very thoughtful. 
                </p>
